## App Description:

Iterate is an educational app that teaches programming, taking the practical knowledge of Java and combining it with the ease of use of Scratch. In essence, it takes the best from both worlds and combines it into one well-rounded package. Iterate streamlines past the grittiness of syntax in favor of a more visual, guided experience while still teaching advanced concepts.


## App Design:

Coding with Iterate, there is no such thing as an error: only unexpected results. This is inspired from our summer camp: when we helped kids code their games. For example, if we were helping them write code to move their player around the screen, an typo might cause the player to fly around like crazy, or spasm out uncontrollably. These sorts of errors were almost comical for the middle schoolers, but more importantly, they could be used as a sort of learning experience. Since they weren’t put off by errors (if anything they were enthralled by them), it encouraged them to really analyse their code to find out what went wrong. This sort of passion -- visualizing the debugging process has been a major focus as David and I have developed Iterate. 

## Users:

We aim to market this application to elementary and middle schools. Iterate (and the curriculum provided with it) allows students to learn at their own speed, with plenty of time to digest and play around with what they've mastered. 
In the end, Iterate aims to make computer science a more palatable, inviting experience, taking away the intimidation that so many newcomers experience.  


## Impact:

Computer science isn’t for everyone. It takes a sort of masochist whose willing to stare at a computer screen for hours on end trying to find one little bug. But if we can bring people into the world of CSE and let them realize on their own how rewarding the experience can be, I think it will benefit everyone.
